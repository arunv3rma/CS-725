##### Prediction Poker Hand with Neural Network #####
## Steps for running code from terminal:
1. Go to directory, where code is kept
2. Make sure train.csv and test1.csv file will also in same directory
3. Run following command:
   python main.py

## Brief details about code structure
#A. About activation functions
1. Sigmoid function is used as activation function for each neuron
2. Softmax function is also defined but not used. One can use it at output layer.

#B. Reading data from train data and preparing data for neural network
1. Using numpy function genfromtxt, data is read from train.csv
2. Features(1st 10 columns) and labels(11th column) are separated from train data
3. Bias is added in features by adding column of 1.
4. As there are only 9 classes of data(from frequency distribution), 9-dimensional one hot encoding is done
5. Data centring and whitening is done, but not used.

#C. Neural network design and learning model
1. Network structure: Input layer - 11 neurons, Hidden layer - 60 neurons, Output layer - 9 neurons
2. Small weights are taken randomly
3. Minibatch is used with batch size 1600
4. Learning rate is taken 0.0035 and maximum number of iteration is taken 5000
5. Dynamic change is learning rate is implement but not used.
6. Error function is mean soured error.

#D. Getting result on test data
1. Using learned weights, class prediction for each test data point has been done.
