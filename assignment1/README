# Notes:
1. I have divided train_data into train(70%) and test(30%) with initial random state parameter of cross_validation
 method of sklearn is 10.
2. Due to lack resources, I am not able to tune models.
3. I have done cross validation of model and computed rmse value for different model for above train and test data.

# To run code, please type this command:
python model.py
Output: Root Mean Square Error = 12096.1907456

Note: By default, it is linear regression model
Score on test Data(using full data) = 48506106.28316 [Best]

For Lasso Regression, please type this command:
python model.py l
Output: Root Mean Square Error = 12095.204676
Score on test Data = 49460052.10033

For Ridge Regression, please type this command:
python model.py r
Output: Root Mean Square Error = 12096.2173506
Score on test Data = 49472742.35036

For Support Vector Regression, please type this command:
python model.py s
Output:  Root Mean Square Error = 12359.1978355
Score on test Data = 52769486.94649
